=== DESCRIPTION ===

My own attempt to combine everything I know about
front-end into one portfolio website of mine.

I used vanilla JS and CSS. No frameworks -- just used
what lil' brain I have to devise my own algorithms.

NOTE: I did use the three.js library in order to get the 3d
rendered geometry, though. I did make my own DIY orthogonal perspective
in a separate project if you're interested though :)
